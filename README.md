## Abstract

A recent econometric literature has critiqued the use of regression discontinuities where administrative 
borders serves as the 'cutoff'. Identification in this context is difficult since multiple treatments can 
change at the cutoff and individuals can easily sort on either side of the border. This note extends the 
difference-in-discontinuities framework discussed in Grembi et. al. (2016) to a geographic setting. The 
paper formalizes the identifying assumptions in this context which will allow for the removal of 
time-invariant sorting and compound-treatments similar to the difference-in-differences methodology.
